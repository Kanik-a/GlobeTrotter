Hotel and Flight booking web application

System design
The system is designed to process data about hotels and rooms as well as flights available in a
specified city. On the index page, the user will have the option to sign up or login, additionally the
user will also be able to complete their purchase without signing up or logging into the website. The
homepage provides the input boxes so that users can input destination, checkin and checkout dates.
Based on the destination provided, the list of hotels is rendered to the users and they are offered to
select the options based on price, guest rating and availability as per the checkin and checkout dates.
On this page users also have the option to sort the results based on prices. Once selection is done by
the users, they are presented with a list of rooms along with details such as room type, room price,
amenities, bed type and room size. Finally, the user will then be able to book a room and provide
payment details and receive a BookingID that will be used to access information about any past or
present bookings made by them.
Similarly, the customer can click on the ‘Flights’ tab in order to access a search bar where they can
enter details such as - city of departure, city of arrival, departure and arrival dates. They will then be
presented with flights from a range of airlines and prices that they can choose from. After completing
their booking, another BookingID will be generated through which they can view their flight bookings
in the ‘My Bookings’ tab.
Users can also login to the portal for making any modifications to their existing bookings.
Site admins have the privilege to get business insights by clicking on the “Site Analytics” tab, where
they can view how many users registered, logged in, number of bookings done in each month and
available vs booked hotels to make informed decisions.
